* This project uses concepts learned in Section 31: Build Your Own RESTful API From Scratch

* RESTful API. Client communicates to the server using HTTP requests. The API represents the services that the server can respond to when a client makes a request. REST is an architectural style for designing APIS. A RESTful API uses HTTP Request Verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE) and Specific Pattern of Routes/Endpoint URLs.

* Allows to fetch, create, update and delete articles. 

* Uses express, mongoose, mongodb and postman to visualise the API services.
