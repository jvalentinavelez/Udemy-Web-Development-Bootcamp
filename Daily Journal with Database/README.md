# Blog Post with Database #

* This project uses concepts learned in Section 30: Boss Level Challenge 4 - Blog Website Upgrade

* Compared to the other website "Blog Post", this one allows to save the posts created, because it uses MongoDB and Mongoose.

* Uses Node, MongoDB, mongoose, ejs, express, lodash and bodyparser.

* To run it, use "nodemon app.js" and "mongod --dbpath ~/data/db". To visualise the database use "sudo mongo --shell"
